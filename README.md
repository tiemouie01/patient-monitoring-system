# Patient Monitoring System

This project is a simple patient data viewer that fetches and displays patient data from a Firebase database. The website is implemented using pure HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Usage

This project is used to fetch and display patient data. It uses the `getPatientData` function from the `firebase.js` file to fetch data for a specific patient. The patient ID is hardcoded in the `index.js` file.

The fetched data is then passed to the `renderPatientInfo` and `renderTimestampHistory` functions from the `ui.js` file to display the patient's information and timestamp history respectively.

The `initInteraction` function from the `interaction.js` file is used to initialize any interactions.
